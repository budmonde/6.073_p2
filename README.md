# Magescape -- Unity2D Game

This Project was my first video game project I worked on for the course CMS.611: Creating Video Games in Spring 2017. The video game is a two-player top-down dungeon-crawler.

#### Team members:
- Costa Mustaklem (KGMIT)
- David Mueller (drmueller)
- Monde Duinkharjav (budmonde)

## Course Assignment Requirements

Goal: Create a two-player 2D digital prototype in Unity, developed in a short time frame, based on a concept developed in assignment 1. The game must run on Chrome and require only a mouse and/or keyboard. Plan tests, playtest with others and alter the design based on player feedback.

Development schedule: 2 weeks of fast prototyping

Requirements:
- Meets themed constraint: Asymmetry
  - Two players interact with the same mechanic to perform different roles or strategies. Each player must face a different set of meaningful decisions to accomplish success. The game can be competitive or cooperative.
- Need not have an end state but must communicate success or failure.
- Use the digital medium to reinforce the game feel of the mechanics.
- Maximum game time: 5 minutes for a single playthrough.
- Two local players only.
- 3D, networking, and custom hardware are not allowed.
- Players can pick up & start playing the game with no external instructions (although an in-game help screen is allowed and recommended!)
- Game must be delivered as a browser game to be run on Chrome using Unity. No other software or plug-ins should be required.

## Personal Notes

This project was my first attempt at using Unity to make a video game. For this project I've spent the bulk of the time to actually learn how to use the Unity Engine. Due to the obvious time constraint, we were unable to ship a "functional" game and settled with the bare minimum that would be remotely acceptable. I'm not particularly proud of this project but it's a good reference point for where I started off.

## Acknowledgements

The game was built using Unity 5.3 with C# used for scripting. We don't really have any assets to speak of but the project structure and design was based off of many Unity tutorials on Youtube. This project source code is licensed under the MIT License. (tbh idk what that means but whatevs)
