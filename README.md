# MIT CMS.611  / 6.073 Project 2: GAME TITLE SUBJECT TO CHANGE

This is a video game developed for CMS.611 / 6.073, Creating Video Games Course as taught at MIT in Spring 2017. This project demonstrates an example of asymmetrical gameplay for two players. The game was created Unity 5.3.

Currently, have not yet deployed the game's build for browsers so you will have to download the source code and build it using.

Current todos:
- Create a depleting manabar for the wizard
- Create a navigatable terrain
- Test and debug the enemy path finding script within the newly built terrain

Beyond these immediate todos, it's hard to determine what features the game specifically requires so we will need to reiterate on the design decisions once the above features are completed.
